                 tensor imaging. It consists of estimating an effective
                 diffusion tensor, Deff, within a voxel, and then displaying
                 useful quantities derived from it. We show how the phenomenon
                 of anisotropic diffusion of water (or metabolites) in
                 anisotropic tissues, measured noninvasively by these NMR
                 methods, is exploited to determine fiber tract orientation and
                 mean particle displacements. Once Deff is estimated from a
                 series of NMR pulsed-gradient, spin-echo experiments, a
                 tissue's three orthotropic axes can be determined. They
                 coincide with the eigenvectors of Deff, while the effective
                 diffusivities along these orthotropic directions are the
                 eigenvalues of Deff. Diffusion ellipsoids, constructed in each
                 voxel from Deff, depict both these orthotropic axes and the
                 mean diffusion distances in these directions. Moreover, the
                 three scalar invariants of Deff, which are independent of the
                 tissue's orientation in the laboratory frame of reference,
                 reveal useful information about molecular mobility reflective
                 of local microstructure and anatomy. Inherently tensors (like
                 Deff) describing transport processes in anisotropic media
                 contain new information within a macroscopic voxel that
                 scalars (such as the apparent diffusivity, proton density, T1,
                 and T2) do not.",

                 design experiments from which Deff is estimated. This estimate
                 is validated using isotropic and anisotropic media, i.e.,
                 water and skeletal muscle. It is shown that significant errors

  abstract    = "Diffusion tensor imaging is used to measure the diffusion of
                 water in tissue. The diffusion properties carry information
                 about the relative organization and structure of the
                 underlying tissue. In the case of a single voxel containing
                 both tissue and a fast diffusing component such as free water,
                 a single diffusion tensor is no longer appropriate. A
                 two-tensor free water elimination model has previously been
                 proposed to correct for the case of volume mixing. Here, this
                 model was implemented in a straightforward but novel manner
                 without the use of spatial constraints. The optimal
                 acquisition parameters were investigated through Monte Carlo
                 simulations and human brain imaging studies. At a
                 signal-to-noise ratio of 40 with 64 diffusion-weighted
                 encoding images, the most accurate estimates of fast diffusion
                 signal were obtained with two diffusion-weighted shells

                 500\texttimes{}{}32 and 1500\texttimes{}{}32. The potential
                 bias in fractional anisotropy induced by this two-compartment
                 model was more than an order of magnitude less than the error
                 of using the single diffusion tensor model in the presence of
                 partial volume effects with free water. This strategy may be
                 useful for characterizing the diffusion of tissues adjacent to
                 cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), tissues affected by edema, and
                 removing artifacts from blurring and ghosting of the CSF

  abstract    = "The diffusion tensor is typically assumed to be positive
                 definite. However, noise in the measurements may cause the
                 eigenvalues of the tensor estimate to be negative, thereby
                 violating this assumption. Negative eigenvalues in diffusion
                 tensor imaging (DTI) data occur predominately in regions of
                 high anisotropy and may cause the fractional anisotropy (FA)
                 to exceed unity. Two constrained least squares methods for
                 eliminating negative eigenvalues are explored. These methods,
                 the constrained linear least squares method (CLLS) and the
                 constrained nonlinear least squares method (CNLS), are
                 compared with other commonly used algebraic constrained
                 methods. The CLLS tensor estimator can be shown to be
                 equivalent to the linear least squares (LLS) tensor estimator
                 when the LLS tensor estimate is positive definite. Similarly,
                 the CNLS tensor estimator can be shown to be equivalent to the
                 nonlinear least squares (NLS) tensor estimator when the NLS
                 tensor estimate is positive definite. The constrained least
                 squares methods for eliminating negative eigenvalues are
                 evaluated with both simulations and in vivo human brain DTI
                 data. Simulation results show that the CNLS method is, in
                 terms of mean squared error for estimating trace and FA, the
