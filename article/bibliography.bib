                 tensor imaging. It consists of estimating an effective
                 diffusion tensor, Deff, within a voxel, and then displaying
                 useful quantities derived from it. We show how the phenomenon
                 of anisotropic diffusion of water (or metabolites) in
                 anisotropic tissues, measured noninvasively by these NMR
                 methods, is exploited to determine fiber tract orientation and
                 mean particle displacements. Once Deff is estimated from a
                 series of NMR pulsed-gradient, spin-echo experiments, a
                 tissue's three orthotropic axes can be determined. They
                 coincide with the eigenvectors of Deff, while the effective
                 diffusivities along these orthotropic directions are the
                 eigenvalues of Deff. Diffusion ellipsoids, constructed in each
                 voxel from Deff, depict both these orthotropic axes and the
                 mean diffusion distances in these directions. Moreover, the
                 three scalar invariants of Deff, which are independent of the
                 tissue's orientation in the laboratory frame of reference,
                 reveal useful information about molecular mobility reflective
                 of local microstructure and anatomy. Inherently tensors (like
                 Deff) describing transport processes in anisotropic media
                 contain new information within a macroscopic voxel that
                 scalars (such as the apparent diffusivity, proton density, T1,

                 about the relative organization and structure of the
                 underlying tissue. In the case of a single voxel containing
                 both tissue and a fast diffusing component such as free water,
                 a single diffusion tensor is no longer appropriate. A
                 two-tensor free water elimination model has previously been
                 proposed to correct for the case of volume mixing. Here, this
                 model was implemented in a straightforward but novel manner
                 without the use of spatial constraints. The optimal
                 acquisition parameters were investigated through Monte Carlo
                 simulations and human brain imaging studies. At a
                 signal-to-noise ratio of 40 with 64 diffusion-weighted
                 encoding images, the most accurate estimates of fast diffusion

                 bias in fractional anisotropy induced by this two-compartment
                 model was more than an order of magnitude less than the error
                 of using the single diffusion tensor model in the presence of
                 partial volume effects with free water. This strategy may be
                 useful for characterizing the diffusion of tissues adjacent to
                 cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), tissues affected by edema, and
                 removing artifacts from blurring and ghosting of the CSF

              MRI that can be used to measure structural features of brain
              white matter. Many methods have been developed to use dMRI data
              to model the local configuration of white matter nerve fiber
              bundles and infer the trajectory of bundles connecting different
              parts of the brain. Dipy gathers implementations of many
              different methods in dMRI, including: diffusion signal
              pre-processing; reconstruction of diffusion distributions in
              individual voxels; fiber tractography and fiber track
              post-processing, analysis and visualization. Dipy aims to provide
              transparent implementations for all the different steps of dMRI
              analysis with a uniform programming interface. We have
              implemented classical signal reconstruction techniques, such as
              the diffusion tensor model and deterministic fiber tractography.
              In addition, cutting edge novel reconstruction techniques are
              implemented, such as constrained spherical deconvolution and
              diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) with deconvolution, as well as
              methods for probabilistic tracking and original methods for
              tractography clustering. Many additional utility functions are
              provided to calculate various statistics, informative
              visualizations, as well as file-handling routines to assist in
              the development and use of novel techniques. In contrast to many
              other scientific software projects, Dipy is not being developed
              by a single research group. Rather, it is an open project that
              encourages contributions from any scientist/developer through
              GitHub and open discussions on the project mailing list.
              Consequently, Dipy today has an international team of

                 eigenvalues of the tensor estimate to be negative, thereby
                 violating this assumption. Negative eigenvalues in diffusion
                 tensor imaging (DTI) data occur predominately in regions of
                 high anisotropy and may cause the fractional anisotropy (FA)

                 eliminating negative eigenvalues are explored. These methods,
                 the constrained linear least squares method (CLLS) and the

                 compared with other commonly used algebraic constrained

               directional dependence) with the underlying microstructure of
