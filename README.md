# Free-water-elimination-DTI
This repository contains all necessary functions to fit the free water
elimination DTI.

When publishing or disclose any result obtained through the use of the
this procedures please include the following reference:

Neto Henriques, R. (...)

The fit procedures were based on the work proposed by Hoy et al. (2014). For 
more details on the implementation are reported in article.md. For an example 
of how to run this procedure in a real data please give a look to the ipython
notebook run_realdata.ipynb. For a quantitative evaluation of the technique
using monte carlo simulation please see the notebook run_sim1.ipynb
(this evaluation reproduces the results of Hoy et al. (2014). Finally
in the notebook supplementary_info.ipynb, we justify some of the 
details of free water elimination model implementations.
